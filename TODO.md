- remove yt-dlp.exe and use system version instead (so it works on Windows + Mac + Linux)
- stop writing out text for pinned and shoutouts and pay posts
- rip paid posts if they've been paid for (will need working example)
- log errors to a file in the current working folder so we know which posts failed
- picture series are not using the longer filename structure
- legacy rename script:
    - depending on environment, write either bash script or batch file (currently only latter)
    - short filenames are detected as legacy filenames so the log entry is wrong, and an unnecessary legacy rename script is written
    - picture series are not writing to legacy rename script
- make console log nicer (clean up or offer debug levels, use colours etc)
- is there a way to make yt-dlp download faster?
